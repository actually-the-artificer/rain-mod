#Rainworld Slugcats

A mod, based around adding content from the indie game, "Rain World". It includes some iconic monsters and a fewnew items. It also does not include any Downpour content.

#Features

- Adds the basic slugcat types into CDDA: The Monk, Survivor, and Hunter.

- A few enemies are also present. The Lizards, Dropwigs, and Daddy Long Legs exist!

- A Slugcat mutation tree is present for people who desire to turn their characters into their very own rain-averse monstrosity.

- Playing as a Slugcat is allowed! Now, spears are not the sole armament of slugcats everywhere. Wield the power of martial arts and machine guns to take down your enemies!
